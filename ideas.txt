1. Find all possible ways including dead ends - exhaust the map, so that all paths are
explored. Then pick the list that leads to the treasure with the shortest list size -
 least moves.

No path (list) can be longer than (w)width * l(length), to avoid circling paths.
A path is finished under the conditions that:
a) it is too long - it cannot be longer than w * l
b) it runs to a dead end
c) it finds runs into the treasure

2. Draw the map, in the fashion in which a page is printed - from top to bottom in lines.
From the map that is drawn, trace paths from the treasure to the beginning. Choose the
shortest path.
